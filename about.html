              On November 2, 2001, Vyom Desai made his debut into this world in Kolkata. While Rani made her debut on Aug 31, 2002 in Warangal. Then Vyom moved to arizona when he was 15 and rani was already in Arizona.  No one knew that one day both of their worlds would collide and produce something extrordinary.

              We met shortly when I came here but you kind of hated boys so did not talk to me, what could have happened if you would have. Then we met again in Mountain Pointe/ Honors Algebra 3-4 where I was the ultimate nerdy kid and you were the goofy one who guided me on how to talk to girls. Reverse Psychology achieved I have used it to pick you up bbg. But basically a little sad ending at the end since you shifted to online school because you dated some butthole. But abhi to party shuru hui hain.

              Freshman year at ASU, it is absolutely wild just thinking about it the memories at Sonora with you, Suhit, Siddharth, Chanu, Diven (kinda not existent tho), Saad just everyone wild (Wo din bhi kya the). The times that we were sitting at the dining hall fighting or just sitting at sonora doing random things, hookah, the rec room and using peoples M&G are some amazing moments we will never ever forget.

              Then during that first year we started dating, I still remember the first time I told Suhit just that the feeling of happiness. I know there were some bad and not so good moments but I am grateful for everything that we have gone through during that period of time and I wouldn't trade any of it for the world. Us going on a double date with chanu and rachna, fooling around in sids room, being with each other 24/7 in the sonora, memorial union everywhere. Those days were a whirlwind of wild and unforgettable moments, and they filled our hearts with happiness that will stay with us forever.

              Then came the very rough and kinda good patch where we were friends and something more, where we always had feelings but it just did not happen at that point in time. Then COVID hit too and it was just very complicated but during the time we started talking more and more. We both dated someone where you dated a person who you turned gay and I dated someone. During that time I did a lot of chasing and I know you say I don't make you feel the same way. I think this is thing that every guy does they love love to chase. But know this I will never stop chasing you and loving you ever now. We did a lot of things during that time spending time together and I believe this is the time that got us close and made us last this long because we truly valued what we have.

              Okay so now the real stuff dating part II, 2 years that is a long time but I do not know why it just feels like I have known you forever and we have been together forever. We had some amazing memories over these two years going through a tons of things together but that is what made us stronger and has made us inseperable. Even though I am such a nice nice boyfriend you get mad at me but it is okay I accept your apology. We both have our negatives but I believe that we balance those out and we will work on covering each others negatives. That being said we also have a lot of positives and I know the time is hard right now doing long distance but I promise I am not going away and we are going to spend years and years together making memories and making each other happy. Everyday I will make sure to make it known on how much I love you and you continue being your amazing self because there is no one like you.
